# LCD-traffic-light-control

Coded by Chunguang(Eric) Xie in 2018

This is a practice project using TIVA tm4c123 micro-controller, a touchable LCD screen, wires, breadboard and three LEDs.
The user could control the traffic light's pattern by pressing the buttons on the LCD screen.
There're several patterns by flashing the LEDs rapidly (green, red and yellow patterns).


Have fun!
